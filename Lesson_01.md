### Supervised learning

input x to output y

Give examples(dataset) to the computer
Computer learn from examples and is able to predict the results

**Types**

**Regression** - predict a number infinitely many possible outputs

**Classification** -  predict categories, small number os possible outputs


**Unsupervised learning**

Find something(patterns) in unlabaled data

Clustering - groups similar data

Data comes with input x but no output y

Anamoly detection

Dimensionality reduction
