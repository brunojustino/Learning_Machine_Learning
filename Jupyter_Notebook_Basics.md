### Jupyter Notebook

"A notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls. A notebook, along with an editor (like JupyterLab), provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others."

Jupyter Notebook works by creating cells. In each cell you can run python code or
Markdown text.

After you run a cell you'll see a number indicating when the cell was executed.
This is important because some cells most be executed before other to 
your code work, for example, import commands.

A variable created in one cell can be used in another cell.

Jupyter has two different keyboard input modes. When you outside the cell
and when you inside the cell. You can see if you inside the cell by checking the cells
borders. Each mode has its own shortcut.

You can hit escape to exit edit mode. Then, you can use up/down arrow keys to navigate
between each cell. When you in the cell you want to edit you can just hit enter.

While in command mode you can hit M to transform the cell into Markdown cell or hit
Y to transform the cell to a code cell.
